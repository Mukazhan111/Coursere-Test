		<section>
			The Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is a mid-engine sports car, designed and developed in Germany by the Volkswagen Group and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti. It was named after the racing driver Pierre Veyron.
			The Super Sport version of the Veyron is recognised by Guinness World Records as the fastest street-legal production car in the world, with a top speed of 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph). The Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse was the fastest roadster in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph) in a test on 6 April 2013.
			The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuß and the exterior was designed by Jozef Kabaň of Volkswagen, with much of the engineering work being conducted under the guidance of engineering chief Wolfgang Schreiber. The Veyron includes a sound system designed and built by Burmester Audiosysteme.

		<p id="p2">BMW M2</p>
		<section>
			The BMW 2 Series is a subcompact executive car (C-segment) produced by BMW. The 2 Series has several different body styles. It is available as a compact coupé that replaced the 1 Series coupé, or as a convertible model that replaces the 1 Series convertible in the BMW lineup. There is also a new compact MPV body style, which BMW refers to as an Active Tourer.
			The 2 Series Active Tourer mechanicals are unrelated to the coupé and convertible models'. While it shares the 2 Series name, it is built on a totally different front wheel drive platform that is shared with the third generation MINI Cooper, dubbed UKL2.
			The 2 Series currently competes with new models from Audi and Mercedes-Benz, the A3 Sedan and the CLA Class. In June 2015, BMW also released a seven seater 2 Series Gran Tourer.
